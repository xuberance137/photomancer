People who talk intelligently and write with clarity are usually good thinkers. When one has a well organized message and a well articulated speech, it is a pretty clear indication of good thought on the topic and good thinking in general. In order to explain an idea or communicate a concept, one must have a very well organized train of thought on that idea or concept. Else, it becomes impossible to form a new thinking in another person’s mind.

This is a reason why doctoral degree holders are respected for their ability to “think” about abstract and “ill defined” problems and bring clarity to those problem sets and solutions to a subset of those problems. This ability for “abstract” problem solving and the grit to relentlessly pursue a problem with passion and undiminished enthusiasm is a critical part of their nature (either self cultivated or acquired through training).

On the contrary, someone with good thinking might now always demonstrate good communication. Good communication requires good thinking and other traits.
