“Leadership is a matter of choice and not rank” - Simon Sinek, TED talk

“leadership" with a little ‘l' because it is part of the nature of people who embody it.

When I often think about leadership, I am tempted to frame thoughts in the context of service. Leadership is often directed towards a specific goal. A leader without a purpose is as good as not leading. However, the purpose could be broad. In the case of politicians, it is broader enough to span geography, time and ethnicities.

Fundamental to leadership is empathy. Interestingly, good managers often suggest empathy training for newly promoted managers. The reason is obvious: for good leadership to prevail and propagate, it is essential to demonstrate empathy and convince people that the leadership is committed to their goals. If leadership is territorial and non-inclusive, they are often seen as non-empathetic which dissuades them from believing in the leadership.  A leader who does not hold the respect and belief of his tribe is doomed to fail. When I see warlords or fiefdom centric leaders, I am often inclined to stay away as they are incapable of demonstrating any empathy to someone outside their tribe. When a leader through his hard work becomes the default choice to lead an initiative, his power is absolute and through choice, not through rank.

Mediocre people under good leadership vs good people under mediocre leadership: I have reason to believe strongly that mediocre people under strong leadership are much better off that great people under mediocre leadership. The reason being that good leaders make great people out of good people. By promoting strong work ethics, encouraging learning and rewarding performance, they create a culture where people are given opportunity to grow and possibilities to succeed. When smart and ambitious people are placed under shorts sighted mediocre leaders, they often get disillusioned, demoralized and quit. This is because, ambitious people seek opportunity and mediocre leadership is often times incapable of creating such opportunities for their tribe.
