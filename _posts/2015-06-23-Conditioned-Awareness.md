People often suggest that in order for us to be [successful] we need structure. I am of the opinion that structure can often take the form of conditioned awareness. The kind of awareness that comes from knowing what to seek out in the midst of several options and innumerable possibilities. For example, when one wakes up in the morning, an adult has a number of different ways to start his/her day. Still, having structure and strong awareness of ones environment, daily schedule and top priorities allows one to start the day with a headstart on accomplishing goals. This is often considered the corner stone of the routine of highly successful people.

Tim Ferris talks about morning rituals and eliminating options and sticking to a minimal set for daily routine items that leaves attention for other things where decisions need to made. Time without attention is of no value.  Conditioned awareness coupled with daily rituals makes us more productive.
