In multimedia, audio/video in particular, data is the predominant component of the payload and metadata helps describe the data in the payload for better control and management of the data. For text, the metadata can be any number of items.  A good example is that of Twitter. Twitter is metadata heavy. A tweet has up to 140 characters in payload/data and the metadata can be ~5KB of total content when represented in uncompressed JSON. This metadata provides a wealth of information on the creator, tweeter, data passage, location, context and adoption.
