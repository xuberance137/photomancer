Picking up something new quickly requires a methodology. What would be a plausible right methodology? I propose the following:

[1]Google first but only for a few minutes. Don’t spend your entire skimming cream. Go a little deeper!

[2]Sketch out the new concept in your own way centered around something that matters to you. You tend to remember it better.

[3]Then review what experts have to say about it. How do they think about this concept? This helps develop a more mature perspective very quickly.

[4]Try and explain the concept to someone else in a succinct and measured way using as little jargon as possible. The more basic your explanation is, the more thorough your understanding could be.

From [Nir Eyal]:

"At my first professional job, with a multimillion-dollar deal at stake, I couldn’t fake it—I had to get up to speed. I started by getting a lay of the land on what’s already known. Next, I synthesized what I’d learned with a few rough sketches and then got on the phone with industry experts who could help me spot the gaps. Finally, I broke down the problem and practiced explaining what I’d learned in simple language that anyone could follow."
