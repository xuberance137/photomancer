Picking up something new quickly requires a methodology. What would be a plausible right methodology? I propose the following:

1. Google first but only for a few minutes. Don’t spend your entire skimming cream. Go a little deeper!

2. Sketch out the new concept in your own way centered around something that matters to you. You tend to remember it better.

3. Then review what experts have to say about it. How do they think about this concept? This helps develop a more mature perspective very quickly.

4. Try and explain the concept to someone else in a succinct and measured way using as little jargon as possible. The more basic your explanation is, the more thorough your understanding could be.

From [Nir Eyal]:

"At my first professional job, with a multimillion-dollar deal at stake, I couldn’t fake it—I had to get up to speed. I started by getting a lay of the land on what’s already known. Next, I synthesized what I’d learned with a few rough sketches and then got on the phone with industry experts who could help me spot the gaps. Finally, I broke down the problem and practiced explaining what I’d learned in simple language that anyone could follow."
