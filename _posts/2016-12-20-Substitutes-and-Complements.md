I've been thinking more about the role of subsitutes and complements when analysing the pricing of new products. Substitute products are those that can serve as a repalcement to some or all of the functionality of the new product while complementary products are those that devilver functionality and utility in tandem with the new product. [Joel Spolsky] has given us some very interesting examples of substitues and complements with broad generalizations. For example, chicken is a substitute for beef and hotels reseravations are complmentary to airline tickets.

The interesting thing to note is that when it comes to pricing, substitutes bring down the prices of a product while complements bring up the price of a product. This has a few different ramifications:

1. In a highly competitive market, a product had limited pricing power if it's doing something similar to it's subsitutes.

2. Compatibility with other key products in a workflow allow for better complmentary behavior and hence higher pricing. 

4. [User network effects] lead to less substition and more complimentary behavior. 

3. In a tiered model, where you selectively price your product in tiers based on increasing complementary functionality. This would be a way to break out of the competition.

5. Tiered pricing also allows for a mix of competitive and complementary functionality. 

In the space of enterprise software, products seldom reside in isolation. Compatibility with competitive products is often part of the go to market plan. However, tiered pricing, unique value add across tiers and partnerships with the right complementary product vendors will allow one to address both differentiation and adoption for a new product in an existing market.
