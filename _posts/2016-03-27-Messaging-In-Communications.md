In the current world of apps and interpersonal communications, what exactly is messaging? Is it limited to the concept of sending text( and media) from one person( or entity) to another? A fundamental of interpersonal communications is CONTEXT. Context defines the nature of interpersonal communications and the nature of reflex and reciprocity in communications. If messaging is taking on the route of being a “reasonable” alternative to phone calls, it needs to be able to provide context.

- Now let’s look at the built in messenger application that comes with any phone. It is purely an application that allows the user to send text and media to other “phone numbers/email ids”.  The only actual context is the the communication history. The context is entirely missing.

- Next, let’s look at iMessage. It allows for seamless communication history between different user devices (macbook, iPad, iPod Touch, iPhone). However, the context is still highly limited.

- Next, let’s look at slack. It allows different members of a team to communicate with one another using the fast slack messenger with broad limitations on message size. In the context of the project, this allows for highly effective communication between team members because the context is contained in the slack project and its associated channels. However, communication is limited to walled gardens of teams that are working together on a project. If one wants to message a friend who is not on the project, they need to use methods outside of slack, in other words, another application.

- The final example is that of Facebook messenger. Here, the social context is pronounce. When one messages another, they can immediately see and review the most recent posts, latest status which allow for better context that enables better communication. However, not everyone with a phone is on Facebook messenger all the time. However, AQ is higher on phone. In comes the WhatsApp value proposition: 900M+ daily active users and growing (as of Sept 2015). With a large install base on smartphones globally(and more importantly in the developing nations and emerging markets), it has the potential of introducing a contextually aware messaging service.

A contextually aware messaging service is one that can one day be a worthy substitute to phone conversations when data/time/geospatial constraints demand the substitution.

We can define accessibility quotient as follows:
AQ = Accessibility Quotient = time when one communicator is accessible to another communicator/time elapsed = (# people accessible/# people desired to be accessed) * (frequency of interruptive access intended * normalized mean interruption time over population / time elapsed)
