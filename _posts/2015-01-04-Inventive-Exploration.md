When engrossed in the invention process and fueling innovative thinking and idea generation, one  can be in the phase of “exploration”. I have come to the realization that true invention (and henceforth innovation) is a result of thoughtful exploration.

The distinction between invention (v. inventing) and innovation (v. innovating) is that innovation requires a certain amount of execution on top of the invention. Invention are technical the result of generation of an idea that is “new” and “useful”. Now the prefix “new” in itself is an interesting concept. I would call it the biggest “invention” in vocabulary. When one enters an invention fair, it is hard to recognize an idea or invention that is entirely new. The “new” in new is always incremental; sometimes more than at other times. To make an idea “useful”, one often needs to map the “new” to an application to showcase it's usefulness. This requires thoughtful execution of the application to bring it to a useable form such that a standard observer(or domain novice) can experience and appreciate it’s utility. Innovation take this one step further, where a vast majority of people can experience and henceforth appreciate the value of a certain inventive step. Often times, this is where new businesses are built.

When assessing an idea for it’s business potential one asks the following questions:

- Is this idea new (has someone done the exact same idea before and met with any success of failure)

- Is this the right time for pursuing the idea? Is it ahead or behind its time? Pursuing a “more” new invention that is timed wrong is at times less fruitful that pursuing “less” new idea that is timed correctly

- Will anyone value this invention enough to use it or pay for using it. This is always a tricky question. 

Technologies that thrive in the mobile and web ecosystem has taught us that the answer to this question is often unclear in the beginning and over the course of time, the value proposition to the one who sells and one who uses become clear and businesses can be built

To summarize, IDEAs are plenty but thoughtful execution of the right ideas at the right time mapped to the right audience are those that promote a true sense of value.
