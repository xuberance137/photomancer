The definition of a thrill is temporary excitement, usually experienced for the first time.  It's thrilling to ride a roller coaster. The fifth time you have to ride it, though, it's more than a chore, it's torture. The definition of the thrill is that it's going to be gone soon. You might have been thrilled to go to your first job the first day. Or thrilled to see the first comment on your blog or thrilled the first time one of your books was translated into another language.
But after that? How can repeating it be thrilling? The work of a professional isn't to recreate thrills. It's to show up and do the work. To continue the journey you set out on a while ago. To make the change you seek to make in the universe.  Thrilling is fine. Mattering is more important.

From Seth Godin, [The Thrill is Gone]:

As Seth mentions, the role of the professional is show up and do the work. For a professional in the position of leadership, it is to show up, do the work and to create an environment that makes others want to show up and do the work. Professionalism is also to encourage and create an example for others to be inspired and to serve as agents of the change that you collectively seek to make in the universe. Thrilling work and inspired people are what get the flight of the ground (Vertical Growth: 0->1). Mattering and persistence is what get the flight to stay in air and soar to new heights (Horizontal Growth: 1->N)
