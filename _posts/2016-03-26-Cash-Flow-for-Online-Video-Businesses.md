title: Cash Flow profiles for an online video business

The above are simple visual descriptions of cash flow profiles for different companies as they startup their business. There are three distinct scenarios that I am trying to identify based on descriptions mentioned in [1]. The first is that of an Airline business. Airline business models are inherently unattractive. Huge upfront costs and tremendous risk at the beginning and there is upside after meeting with success and gaining significant traction. The biggest challenge is the starting costs are prohibitive, require capital with commitment for the long term. That is the investment cycle for the business. One can make an argument that automotive businesses (Lincoln/Tesla/Carma/…) and consumer satellite and drone businesses (Virgin Galactic/SpaceX/Skybox/3DRobotics/…) are similar to this business models. The business models and the time horizon for these businesses are also heavily dependent on existing, new and upcoming regulatory policies that govern their launch. Car safety for automobiles, FAA regulations for satellites and drones.

A more attractive model is that of a popular newsletter. For example, the AAII newsletter/NYT/FT or a paid podcast. In this case the invest cycle is small and the harvest cycle is significant. The main dependency for this model is that the organization (AAII/FT/NYT) have an existing reputation that they have already built prior to pursing an aggressive newsletter business. This can be thought as their legacy from the print era prior to the online newsletter era. In the case of podcasts and there subscriptions, many times these are free and their success is based on advertising or product placement. For these businesses to succeed, their proponents (Tim Ferriss/Dan Brown/Seth Godin) are either willing to work with a prolonged invest cycle or have an established reputation where their can charge and still build a new business based on their reputation from their earlier endeavors.

Moving to the more “new” online models, customer subscription models like Amazon Prime or Netflix or Hulu+ are based on incurring a heavy burden on the invest cycle (building CDNs, investing in buying up a content catalogue, producing their own shows) to build up enough of a recurring subscriber base that creates sustained long term revenue to bring them to a harvest cycle. Often times these harvest cycle projects are hard to model right as they are contingent on the success of the GTM strategy. It is usual for projects to be way off from the actual numbers in the harvest cycle. In many cases, it is also harder to isolate the business from other aspects of the company to evaluate the invest and harvest cycles. For example, in the case of AMZN, it is non trivial to evaluate the investment in the “invest” cycle considering that AMZN has been investing in cloud infrastructure as a business long before delivering their own video subscription service. This has been more of a “piggy back” business development that has the potential to be a new source of long term revenue and long term growth for other aspects of the business like user profiles, user preferences in the store towards delivering high margin products outside of video delivery.

I wanted to use the cash flow visuals to describe a “new online video business”. Consider a startup that is building a video delivery platform from scratch to solve a specific user need. This could be short form video clips or a UGC content portal or an online UGC video editing business. In order to build up a solution that is user friendly and meets customer needs, the product would need to function within appropriate values for latency(network optimization/cloud front), compute time(cloud processing), storage(cloud memory) and back end scale(dynamic cloud load balancing). Let’s assume that the business is starting off with a first product that has a significant invest cycle to build out the service and enable scale. The investment “turns the tide” when the number of active users increases above N after which there is linear growth in revenue. If the company was add a second and third business to the above while reusing the same online video delivery platform, then the “new” costs in the investment cycle are significantly lower than the first business(think development costs) but the added additional revenue from these new businesses are significant. This can lead to a “prolonged" investment cycle but also an “exponential” harvest cycle due to the viral growth in the subscriber base due to these different new businesses. Hence, this model has the potential for huge reward if it incorporates the long term thinking needed (like the one in the airline business) and stays focused on the development of it’s subscriber base that lead to revenue generation.

To Be Added:

- Revenue Plateau in these business models

- YouTube's 'current' business model

- What would it take to make another Youtube (upfront investment cycle and time frame)

- Adding revenue generating subscribers
