We anticipate a future where software is commodity. Lightning fast, community driven, collaborative software development with safe and seamless update cycles will be the norm. This is even more relevant in the space of machine learning (ML).

In the future, machine learning algorithms will be commodity. It will transcend from new knowledge to inert knowledge. The true differentiators between companies/implementations/libraries will be data on which they are trained and the nature in which the data is organized and (pre)processed. More and more machine learning companies will use different forms of newly generated data to train their algorithms in different and hopefully more effective ways.

As more and more people engage in global ML communities like [Kaggle], there will be a increasing larger sense of protection around datasets. We are already seeing this in image datasets like ImageNet. Although that data set is used in many research projects, they community forbids the use of the data for commercial purposes.

This future inspires the notion of a data marketplace. The marketplace will derive value from companies hosting their datasets (anonymously of course) and companies accessing and using these datasets. In effect, you would develop a [Mashape] for datasets. It would necessitate the following:

- A well defined API and schema for the datasets

- A means to validate the data set (prevent replication/plagiarism)

- A means to anonymize source of datasets

- A method to track usage of data in application training

- A pricing model based on usage of data for commercial purposes

The more data that is shared between teams and companies, the more effective the lowest common denominator of ML algorithms will be as a machine pre-trained on existing data is still [better] than an untrained one.

This brings us to the following frontiers:

- How do we incentivize niche companies to share their data?

- How would multiple data sources following different protocols connect to a universal data logger? 

- What business models will enable a transparent, yet anonymous marketplace for ML datasets?
