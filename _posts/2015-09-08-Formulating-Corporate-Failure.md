In recent conversations, we discussed a formulation for corporate failure:
[ignorance] *[arrogance]*[incompetence] => [guaranteed failure]

It’s corollary would be:
[knowledge]*[humility]*[competence] => [possible success]

If an organization has even two of the above three, there is a possibility of success. Let’s look at this on a case by case basis.

CASE A: When an organization is humble and competent but has limited knowledge of the space, they pick the market knowledge up over the course of time. This is demonstrated often by competent organizations that enter new domains of expertise. Think Apple before the iPhone and before them making a mobile device.

CASE B: When an organization is knowledgeable and humble in a space but lack the right core competency, then they can pursue the competence through an acquisition. In an extreme form, when the incompetence is severe and the market is quickly moving, this takes the form of a merger.

CASE C: When an organization is knowledgeable of a market and has the sufficient core competency to excel in that space, humility is optional.
