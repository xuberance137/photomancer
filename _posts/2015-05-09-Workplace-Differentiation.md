Cities in the US attract the most ambitious and most competitive people in the country. They are competing and vying for the best opportunities at the premium avenues for vertical growth [see Zero -> One]. In this environment, what is the right form of work place differentiation? I believe that while managing employees, we come to realize that every employee is different and every employee has a different set of success metrics that they value. While these success metrics are in alignment with the goals of the business, the manager seeks to empower and enable them towards performing to their best ability at these success metrics. Seeing the employees thinking, the manager might also create new opportunities for the business to match what the employees want to do. A classic example is when a startup uses a certain set of technologies because the founders of the startup wanted to learn them and build fluency with the tools that enables these technologies.
In small organizations and small groups, one can create new opportunities for employees because the groups can be tasked with broad goals that allow for enough exclusive thinking and exclusive skills as they allow for intersecting skills.
It might happen that multiple employees have the same internal success metrics. This can lead to intense competition that can be detrimental to the team dynamic. When a team is a collection of individuals with a diverse set of interests and a diverse set of personalities, it enables them to complement each others thinking and one others success metrics.
One thing that would be instrumental to the success of the team would be a shared enthusiasm for the project and a shared mindset of tenacity and willingness to enable the project to succeed.

SMALL -> exclusive and intersecting skills developed at the same time

VARIED -> complementary personalities and success metrics

GRIT -> shared mindset on project vision

When the team has the above 3 elements and a good leadership to support, encourage and guide them, the team and the project become successful.
