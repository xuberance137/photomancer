The recent meteoric growth of platforms for [collaborative consumption] has developed a presence in clothing. However, one might wonder about the consequences of such a trend.

Successful platforms for collaboration like airbnb (room and board for tourists) and uber (transport in cities) are the result of the confluence of social, economical and technological developments. The technological and economical developments that facilitate collaborative consumption are relatively straightforward to realize. Scalable mobile technology with reliable backend services allow for drivers and ride seekers (in the case of uber) and hosts and guests (in the case of airbnb) to communicate and negotiate services with one another. Compared to alternate options for transport and boarding, these alternatives provide for a more economical option but eliminating middlemen and directly connecting the service providers with the service seekers with minimum service facilitation (fueled by technology). Compared to other [models], this form of developing a marketplace is very attractive to service providers who want to make a fast buck with minimum efforts using a simple marketplace platform.

The social aspects of sharing are worth looking at more closely when analyzing success of collaborative consumption. In the case of clothing, there is a certain stigma associated with allowing someone else to use your clothes. One would do this with a close friend but seldom with a stranger, regardless of the amount of gratitude one demonstrates. An extreme would be allowing another person to use your toothbrush for a couple of days. One might allow a date who is sleeping over to use one’s tooth brush; but a stranger, no way! This is where I see a flaw in collaborative consumption for clothing. Personal preferences are profound in the choice of one’s clothing and it would seldom perfectly fit with another’s choice of the same. It could work for Halloween costumes but not for regular clothing.
