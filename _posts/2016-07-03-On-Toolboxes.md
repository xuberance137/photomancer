In his book, ‘On Writing’, Steve King talks about toolboxes for the writing profession and lists vocabulary as one of the primary tools in this toolbox. Further thought on toolboxes and associated tools leads to some interesting frames of reference.

Every profession and every art form has a toolbox. It is not very clear on the right toolboxes for certain professions because either those professions/art forms are new or they exist only amongst a select group of experts. ‘On Writing’ and ‘Elements of Style’ are examples of expert writings on their expertise but all knowledge forms don’t always have this type of expertise broadcast. One example of a space with obscure toolboxes is the world of finance and financial modeling. At a high level, one knows of simple tools like DCF and CAP Models but these is a level of sophistication beyond these when it comes to actual application of these tools to solve real world financial engineering problems. This missing link between known tools and (un)known toolboxes are what make certain science and art fields obscure. Another example of a missing link is that between block chain (tool) and financial processes (toolboxes).

Two prominent questions come to mind:

When does this link get established and widely known? When a field is in the hype cycle, the link is missing as few fully understand the true value of each of the associated tools to the toolbox. At this stage, people who know have the ability to massively monetize on the missing link or manipulate the perception of the link to their benefit. As a field matures and transitions from new to inert knowledge, there are more experts who are leading the charge towards making the link widely know and providing accurate and crowd-curated or peer-reviewed assessment of tools for a particular toolbox.

How well do we need to know the tool? At what level of abstraction should one know the tools when using them in a toolbox? Can one treat them as just knobs on a control panel and experiment? A basic proficiency in the tools allows for a deeper understanding of the toolbox. Just like a good vocabulary allows for better writing, a good understanding of search engines allows for a better SEO toolbox.
