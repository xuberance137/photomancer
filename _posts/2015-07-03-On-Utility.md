When and how can we assess the value of a physical object to us?

Based on the valuation model, the value of an item to a customer is the delta between the derived value and the price paid to gain ownership. Derived value is a function of the utility of the item to the customer and utility in turn is a function of the active time spent with the item.

Active time can be categorized three-fold:

A. Time spent actively using the item. A good example of this an iphone or a macbook. These days, a customer uses his phone and his laptop over a significant percentage of the day and hence they can be source of tremendous value.
B. Time spent in emergency: A good example of such utility is the wheel jack in your car or the spare wheel in the car.
C. Time spent in background: An example of such a utility is a background service (like newsfeed, gmail, notifications, messaging alerts). Often times, the active time of an object in [C] is mirrored by an item in [A] or [B].

For an item in [A], utility is a function of the active time we spent with the item and the larger the # of hours, the larger the value.
