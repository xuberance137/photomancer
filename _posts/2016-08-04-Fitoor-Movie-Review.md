On my flight from Mumbai to London, I watched a more recent Hindi movie called Fitoor. While flying over the English channel, I wanted to pen down my thoughts on the movie while they fresh and alive.

Fitter is a very interesting and scheming adaptation of Dicken’s ‘Great Expectation’, the movie creates a mesmerizing cinematic experience set in modern day, for the most part in the Indian State of Kashmir. Filled with picturesque sets, stellar acting performances and balanced storyline. Often times, movie adaptations of legendary novels are disappointing poorly balanced incarnations of their textual ancestors.

In Fitoor, there is a well produced contrast between the 'stayed-still-in-time' Kashmir and the modern day nightlife, art scene and social culture in New Delhi and London. Could that be a reflection of the reality in Kashmir? I am tempted to believe that to be true: Kashmir, an Indian state that stayed in time when it comes to scenic beauty only to be embellished by religious strife and terrorist activity.

The movie makes a poignant statement around the social class. The contrast is evident in Dicken’s novel but presented in a more pronounced way in the movie. That coupled with the incendiary reaction of Noor to class differences between Firdauz and himself.

Mausam’s character is less developed. Also, the reaction of Noor to his revelation is pretty intense and accusatory unlike the character(Pip?) in Dicken’s novel.

In true Dicken’s style, the movie concludes on a high note, celebrating the long developed love between Noor and Firdauz. Dickens novels often concluded with characters getting what they eventually deserved with the wrong doers being put in place and the good folks ending up in a good place. Fitoor is no different. In true Hindi movie fashion, it is a celebration of true love and the realization of affection and emotions built up over years of two very different characters growing up together inspired by a different set of principles, values and inspiration but eventually in the same place, seeking the same thing at the same time.
