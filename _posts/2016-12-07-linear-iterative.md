Are artists linear thinkers? Does linear thinking lead to faster delivery? how valuable is that?

The above thoughts have been racing in my mind over the last couple of days. While typing this article (which is a creative process), I tend to stroll back on sentences, edit and spell check constantly. That sometimes interrupts my train of thought and slows down my creative output.

However, we do know that often times, truly creative pieces of work, innovative products are developed through the process of prototyping (which is a natively creative process) is produced through constant iteration. The iteration seems to add a tremendous amount of value in that case.

To me it seems more that writing sentences/short stories/articles is often a process with delayed feedback. While writing the article, we are not constantly receiving the feedback from anyone other that ourselves. Hence, we should accept feedback (even from ourselves) only at specific intervals. In between those intervals, there can be no feedback, no return to edit, no cross checking. This will allow the creative process to flow uninterrupted for a “productive” period of time to allow for a “feedback (inch)milestone”.

Productive creatives follow a creative process that is natively linear and iterative. Linear between milestones and iterative at milestones. This allows us to get things out or ship without constantly crosschecking and being bogged down by our own limitations in thinking. If I were to doubt and rethink every statement that I put down in this essay, I would never be able to truly get any creative work out. My suspicion about the quality of my creativity and the value of my creative output would limit me to create anything at all.

This applies to prototyping and decision making around prototyping. Regardless of how iterative the prototyping process is, decisions that are linear have to be made and they need to stick to a timeline. In effect, we have created milestones in an iterative process. Such perspective makes me believe that prototyping is also a fused linear-iterative process that requires tremendous focus and a combination of linear (structured) and iterative (incremental) thinking.
