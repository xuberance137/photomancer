When do we transition from one idea to another in an optimal fashion? Is there a logical point when we feel that we have given enough time and thought to a specific problem or specific idea related to the problem space or a specific solution to the problem? In an ideal world, it would be possible to construct a thought process that is a collection of trains of thought that lead from one  idea to another to form a solution that brings together a well grounded and "thought through” understanding of the problem space and related points of view (PoVs) and deep insight that comes from being “authentic” in that space.

Such solutions are harder to replicate in their entirety as they are the culmination of several days/weeks/months of thinking and are a function of a logical sequence of thoughts. In effect, we are not transitioning to new ideas but rather bridging the gap between problems statements through a deep understanding of the related problem space(s). It is connecting problem statements and problem spaces through ingenious ideas. This is what people refer to as “connecting the dots”.
