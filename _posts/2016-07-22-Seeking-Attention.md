Maxims to live by:

- Unnoticed seems better than unworthy

- In any pressured environment in Seems easier to fade into the background than to face criticism

- In today's world, one doesn't win by being invisible, one wins by being seen and remembered.

- When competition increases, strengths matter less and differences matter more

- The higher the persons income, the more they are paid for who they are rather than what they do

- Rather than focus on what you do, focus on who you are
