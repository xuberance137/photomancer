Very rarely we do get to really understand the true motivations behind a persons actions. When we meet someone who we have an acquaintance with or whom we are introduced to, we have some context. However, how do we really know what the real situation in their life is? Are they succeeding at their passions, are they enjoying their personal relationships, are they learning and gaining the wisdom that they aspire for?

Here are some thoughts worth considering:

1. What are the indicators of the true emotional state of an individual and How do we perceive those indicators when we meet with them? - We can get some sense of this through the way they look and engage with you. What are the words they use to describe their work, their efforts and what they have been doing. How they communicate about others in their lives. A person who is in a troubled relationship will mention the other person in the relationship in a positive or negative light multiple times. As always, the words used to express their current state are indicative of the questions that are being channeled in their mind.

2. How do we interpret those indicators in the light of the context that we have about them? One needs to cognizant of one’s relationship with the individual when interpreting their emotional state.

3. How does the perception and interpretation of these indicators modify our understand of their emotion state?

4. How can we adjust our behavior in the light of our understanding of their emotional state? - As always, it never hurts to demonstrate empathy once we have identified key indicators of another person’s mental state. Empathy helps build a better relationship with the person involved and helps us to better interpret emotional cues in the future.
